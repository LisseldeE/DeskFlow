"""Global low-level mouse hook (WH_MOUSE_LL).

Replaces the previous foreground-window poll for hide-on-outside-click.
The OS delivers every mouse-down on the screen to this hook *before* the
target window sees it, so we can reliably detect a click anywhere — other
apps, the desktop, the taskbar, the tray — not just inside the Qt app.

Design notes
------------
* The hook callback runs synchronously on the thread that installed it
  (and pumps messages) — which is the Qt main thread. Qt signal emit and
  QApplication.activeModalWidget() are therefore safe to call directly.
* Low-level hooks have a strict timeout (LowLevelHooksTimeout, default
  ~300ms); the hook only does a few GetWindowRect calls + an optional
  Qt signal emit, so it stays well under 1ms.
* The CFUNCTYPE callback MUST be kept alive by a strong reference, or the
  GC will free it and Windows will crash the process on the next event.
* Modal dialogs (e.g. RoomConfigDialog) are skipped: Windows already
  denies outside clicks on a modal dialog (deny sound + dialog flash),
  and hiding the family mid-modal would strand the dialog.
