"""Family window registry for focus-aware hide behavior.

The capsule auto-hides when focus leaves it (click outside, alt-tab, etc.).
But some windows are "family" — visual extensions of the capsule such as
the clipboard panel and the room-config dialog. Focus moving to a family
window must NOT trigger a hide.

This module is a process-wide singleton so any widget can register itself
and the capsule's hide logic (nativeEvent / eventFilter / poll) can consult
it without explicit wiring. Weak refs are used so destroyed widgets don't
linger in the registry.
